how to say 'show me sth'?
    you could say mi wilu luku i sth,
    but how to make it a command?
        u jupa luku puha i sth na mi?
        'make be-seen sth to me'

how to express the back or re- part of:
    give back
    take back
    come back
    return
all these words represent a return to a previous state; do we need to be able to express this?
why not instead just:
    give again
    take
    come again
    go again
