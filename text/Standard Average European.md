Standard Average European
--------

This first list comprises features which are very common in European languages, but uncommon elsewhere.

For Tuki Nuwa, features from the first list should be avoided.

01. definite and indefinite articles (e.g. English the vs. a);
02. postnominal relative clauses with inflected, resumptive relative pronouns (e.g. English who vs. whose);
03. a periphrastic perfect formed with 'have' plus a passive participle (e.g. English I have said);
04. a preponderance of generalizing predicates to encode experiencers, i.e. experiencers appear as surface subjects in nominative case (e.g. English I like music instead of Music pleases me, though compare Spanish Me gusta la música, which is of the form "Music pleases me");
05. a passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (e.g. English I am known);
06. a prominence of anticausative verbs in inchoative-causative pairs (e.g. Russian inchoative anticausative izmenit’-sja 'to change (intransitive)' is derived from causative izmenit’ 'to change [something], make [something] change');
07. dative external possessors (e.g. German Die Mutter wusch dem Kind die Haare = The mother washed the child's hair (lit. The mother washed the hair to the child), Portuguese Ela lavou-lhe o cabelo = She washed his hair);
08. verbal negation with a negative indefinite (e.g. English Nobody listened);
09. particle comparatives in comparisons of inequality (e.g. English bigger than an elephant);
10. equative constructions (i.e. constructions for comparison of equality) based on adverbial relative-clause structures. E.g. Occitan tan grand coma un elefant, Russian tak že X kak Y, where coma/kak (historically coming from the adverbial interrogative pronoun "how") are "adverbial relative pronouns" according to Haspelmath.
11. subject person affixes as strict agreement markers, i.e. the verb is inflected for person and number of the subject, but subject pronouns may not be dropped even when this would be unambiguous (only in some languages, such as German, French and Spoken Finnish, e.g. mä oon, "I am" and sä oot, "you are"[4][5]); this feature is called null subject – pro-drop is sometimes mentioned in this context, but is technically a term for a more general phenomenon;
12. differentiation between intensifiers and reflexive pronouns (e.g. German intensifier selbst vs. reflexive sich).

Besides these features, which are uncommon outside Europe and thus useful for defining the SAE area, Haspelmath (2001) lists further features characteristic of European languages (but also found elsewhere):

01. verb-initial order in yes/no questions;
02. comparative inflection of adjectives (e.g. English bigger);
03. conjunction A, B and C;
04. syncretism of instrumental and comitative cases (e.g. English I cut my food with a knife when eating with my friends);
05. suppletivism in second vs. two;
06. no distinction between alienable (e.g. legal property) and inalienable (e.g. body part) possession;
07. no distinction between inclusive and exclusive first-person plural pronouns ("we and you" vs. "we and not you");
08. no productive usage of reduplication;
09. topic and focus expressed by intonation and word order;
10. word order subject–verb–object;
11. only one gerund, preference for finite subordinate clauses;
12. specific "neither-nor" construction;
13. phrasal adverbs (e.g. English already, still, not yet);
14. tendency towards replacement of past tense by the perfect.
