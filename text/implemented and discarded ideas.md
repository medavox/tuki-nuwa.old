Implemented Ideas
------------------

### 'Suli':

* meanings as of change: 
    *mod* big, tall, long, adult, important
    *vt* enlarge, lengthen
    *n* size
* remove 'important' meaning from 'suli'. 
    - Not all big things are important, not all small things aren't
* remove 'heavy' meaning from 'suli'
    - rolling importance, size and weight into one word is a major source of confusion  


* remove 'simple' meaning from 'pona',
    - 'evil', 'complex' meanings from 'ike'

* remove 'divine' meaning from 'sewi'
* remove 'crazy' meaning from 'nasa'
* remove 'lower part' meaning from 'noka'. replace with 'noka pini' = leg ending
* add meanings 'barter/trade' to 'esun'(v)
* remove meaning 'money' from word 'mani'?
* add 'start, beginning' meanings to 'open'

-------

* 'opaka' heavy, difficult
* 'pusiki' important (from welsh bwysig)
* 'kapesi' brown/grey: colour of slate, mud, metal
* 'leko' square, cube, block, square-shaped, cube-shaped
* 'pasila' easy, simple, light (opposite of heavy)

-----

* ilo -> tuka
    - reduce confusion with ijo, which is s
    - loosely inspired by German 'Werkzeug'
* replace sina -> si
    - the word for 'you' is very common; it would be better if it was as short as possible.
* replace (namako, sin) -> nawa
    - 'sin' is too easily confused with 'sina' (now 'si'), and namako is now superfluous.
* replace sitelen -> tesen
    - from french 'dessin', but with a harmonised second vowel
    - 'sitelen' is a false friend in English -- it means drawing/writing, not (web)site
    - tesen is also shorter
* shorten 'kepeken' -> 'usu' (from latin 'usus', and English 'use', with harmonised vowels)
    - 'kepeken' doesn't *sound* like a toki pona word to me. 
    (maybe it has phonotactic rules that have emerged as a result of its vocabulary?)
    - It's also quite long.
* palisa -> kalisa
    - to avoid similarity with pasila

----

Conlang Critic suggests that toki pona could use 3 vowels
to be made even easier for speakers of 3-vowel languages (eg for speakers of Arabic).

----

Merge i and e vowels

These sounds have always been hard to keep separate in my head,
possibly because of the english dialect I was raised in.

I can tell them apart, but I can't always remember which one goes where.

I can't imagine I'm the only one that struggles to disinguish these sounds.

-----

removed all consonant clusters (nanpa, unpa, tenpo, monsi, linja)

I've removed syllable-final n sounds. N can now only be used as a consonant, or at the end of the whole word -- 
NOT at the end of a syllable, next to another consonant.


Discarded Ideas
---------------

 There is a similar argument for l and w.

/l/, and its merged phoneme  /r/, vary a lot in their pronunciation.
These variations may prove to be mutually unintelligible.
If we can afford to leave out a sound we can't all agree on, we should.

* Colour, -coloured (so you can describe a colour using comparisons to other things)
    - there is already the word 'kule' which can be used as above
* 'mete' get/take/receive -- instead use passivity marker with give
    - although this prevents us from using 'mete ike' as 'stealing'
* stone/ball/egg/round
    - found: 'sike' circle, wheel, sphere, ball, cycle, round, cyclical
* co-operate/collaborate/work together (mitarbeiten)
    - just use 'work together', if those words are added

------

consider marking what part of speech a word represents by its ending, similarish to esperanto
(but ONLY mark the POS, no conjugation or anything else!)

so 'utali' could be a battle, and 'utala' is to battle

use -n ending too if we REALLY need more, but that could be overly complex
