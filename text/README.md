Proposed Improvements to Toki Pona
==================================

Goals

1. be easy to learn
2. be easy to pronounce
3. be more expressive than toki pona

4. be easy to understand
    - both in terms of meaning and hearing

The goal of this offshoot is to make an improved version of Toki Pona that is more useful 
as an auxlang.

Although speakers can use phrases to describe things that other languages have a word for,
Toki Pona today lacks words for some basic building-block concepts.
This makes it extremely difficult to be understood clearly without using long,
roundabout, misinterpretable paragraphs for familiar things.

This is not a flaw of Toki Pona, but rather a result of its design.
You are not MEANT to be able express anything complex with it.
Its goal is to simplify speech, distilling the key meaning ; it is an artlang, a language of philosophy.

However, Toki Pona's simplicity has gained it a modest international following,
where it could potentially stumble into the role of an auxlang.
But its extreme simplicity also limits its potential to communicate.
In this role, it needs words for ideas that were previously left out or ignored.

I'm retooling Toki Pona for this new purpose,
hopefully without compromising its central philosophy too much.

The goal of this offshoot is different from that of Toki Pona's -- 
or at least different from its original goal.

Its simplicity is its greatest strength; 
but I think that its inability to express fundamental parts of human existence should be changed.

This document is a work-in-progress.

Word Definition Changes
=====

No conflation between size/height/importance, simplicity/good;
    remove the common human fallacy of spatial-social equality double-meanings

High != hierarchy

----------

* remove 'humble', 'lowly', 'bowing down' meanings from anpa
    - Money is neither simple, good nor necessary to lead a good life
    - In fact why do we even need a word for cattle?
    - why not 'sowelo moku suli' (hopefully meaning large food land-quadruped)?

New Grammar-Words
=================

* question marker word 'ki' - turns a statement into a question of whether the statement is so.
   - a direct translation of the word would be 'is it that', or 'is the following true'
* word meaning multiplier of next number word, so you can say 'four WORD twenty', 'five twenties'
* passivity marker? a word which means the verb is being done TO the object (eg 'po')
    so 'pana' means give, 'po pana' means is given (receive)
    'utala' means attack, 'po utala' means is attacked
* conversion/transformation/application transitive verb? to make something <adjective> eg large + <word> = enlargen?
* marker word for a person or thing that is the one doing the action, eg emitter

Word Name/Spelling Changes
==========================

Spread out words across the phonological space more evenly; reduce similar-sounding wordgroups:


- poki/poka
- ko/kon
- kala/kalama/kama
- nasa/nasin
- pan/pana
- selo/seli/sewi/suli/suwi

There are a finite number of consonant-vowel syllables.

Two words that are made of the same syllables *in the same order* are identical.

Two syllables are said to be 'half-identical' if they share either a consonant or a vowel.

Two words are considered to be 'too similar' if they only differ by a half-similar syllable.

To do: Include ending -n sounds in this model

Phonology
=========

"Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional n. 
If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is optional
(For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants).
The optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n."

These rules produce over 6000 potential dual-syllable words;
so why does Toki Pona (a language with ~120 words) even HAVE 3-syllable words?

The Argument for removing sounds
-------------

We don't even need as many different sounds as toki pona already has,
in order to express the tiny number of words it has.

Should we remove one of the nasal sounds?
they CAN be hard to distinguish from each other when speaking

As I said earlier, toki pona has an overabundance of sounds;
it doesn't need all the sounds it does have.

So why not simplify?

If Toki Nawa sounds a bit like baby speak, that probably means I've achieved my aim:
It should sound so simplistic as to be familiar to everyone.

I'm still not sure about differentiating m and n, as these are easily mistaken for one another.


### Possible New Phonotactic Rules

* should all vowels in a word harmonise?
* require all words start with a consonant, end with a vowel?
    - reduces sandhi, allows words to flow better?


Orthography
-----------

* Map all words to Emojis
* Map all words to Pokemon!
